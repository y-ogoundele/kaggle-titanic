Python script used for data exploration and prediction of survival of passengers

The file titanic-survival-prediction contains a detailed notebook with explanation of my model, exploratory analysis and Python script used for preprocessing and prediction. It goes over the process I followed to predict passengers survival and outlines some assumptions I made over the course of this project.

The file analysis.py contains Python scripts I used during exploratory analysis.
The file main.py contains the script used to predict the survival of passengers.
The file preprocess.py contains functions used to preprocess the training and test sets.
